Results Overview :
- Elasticities between 0- 1 are considered inelastic, as a result the products from rank 1 to 20 are elastic.
- Negative Price Elasticities are located from rank 1 to 20 and this would tell us the likelihood of when price decreases how likely sales demand would increase or vice versa.
- For instance, letâ€™s analyze C1021 located in rank 11 with a negative price elasticity of -1.867437 ; a 10% price decrease in C1021, it increases sales demand by 18.67% or a 10% price increase in C1021, it decreases sales demand by 18.67%
